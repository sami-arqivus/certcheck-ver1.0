# Security Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the CertCheck system and provides guidance for maintaining security best practices.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **Password Hashing**: All passwords are hashed using bcrypt with salt
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based authentication with configurable expiration
- **Token Blacklisting**: Support for token revocation on logout
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks

### 2. Input Validation
- **Pydantic Models**: Strong typing and validation for all API inputs
- **File Upload Validation**: Comprehensive file type, size, and content validation
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Parameterized queries throughout the application

### 3. Security Headers
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Enables XSS filtering
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Enforces HTTPS
- **Content-Security-Policy**: Prevents XSS and code injection

### 4. Rate Limiting
- **Login Endpoints**: 5 attempts per minute
- **Registration Endpoints**: 3 attempts per 5 minutes
- **General API**: 100 requests per minute
- **File Uploads**: 10 uploads per minute

### 5. File Upload Security
- **File Type Validation**: Only allows specific file types
- **File Size Limits**: Configurable size limits per file type
- **Content Validation**: Validates actual file content, not just extension
- **Malicious Content Detection**: Basic checks for suspicious patterns

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Copy `env.security.template` to `.env` and configure:

```bash
# Critical security settings
SECRET_KEY=your_very_long_and_secure_jwt_secret_key_here
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_database_password_here
CORS_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,https://admin.yourdomain.com
```

### Database Security
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable SSL connections
- Regular security updates
- Access control and monitoring

### AWS Security
- Use IAM roles with minimal permissions
- Enable S3 bucket encryption
- Regular access key rotation
- Monitor for unusual activity

## Security Checklist

### Before Production Deployment
- [ ] Change all default passwords
- [ ] Generate strong SECRET_KEY (minimum 32 characters)
- [ ] Configure proper CORS origins
- [ ] Enable HTTPS everywhere
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Configure backup and recovery
- [ ] Test all security features
- [ ] Perform security audit

### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Update dependencies monthly
- [ ] Rotate secrets quarterly
- [ ] Review access logs weekly
- [ ] Monitor for security advisories
- [ ] Test backup restoration
- [ ] Review user permissions

## Security Monitoring

### Logs to Monitor
- Failed login attempts
- Rate limit violations
- File upload rejections
- Database connection errors
- Unusual API usage patterns

### Alerts to Set Up
- Multiple failed logins from same IP
- Unusual file upload patterns
- Database connection failures
- High error rates
- Unauthorized access attempts

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Checklist
1. **Immediate Response**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Preserve evidence
   - Notify security team

2. **Investigation**
   - Analyze logs and metrics
   - Identify attack vector
   - Assess impact

3. **Containment**
   - Block malicious IPs
   - Revoke compromised tokens
   - Update security measures

4. **Recovery**
   - Patch vulnerabilities
   - Restore from clean backups
   - Monitor for recurrence

5. **Post-Incident**
   - Document lessons learned
   - Update security procedures
   - Conduct security review

## Security Testing

### Automated Testing
- Run security scans regularly
- Test rate limiting
- Validate input sanitization
- Check for common vulnerabilities

### Manual Testing
- Penetration testing
- Social engineering tests
- Physical security review
- Access control verification

## Compliance

### Data Protection
- Implement data encryption
- Regular data backups
- Secure data disposal
- User consent management

### Audit Requirements
- Maintain audit logs
- Regular security reviews
- Compliance reporting
- Documentation updates

## Contact Information

- **Email**: security@yourdomain.com
- **Phone**: +1-XXX-XXX-XXXX
- **Emergency**: security-emergency@yourdomain.com

### Reporting Security Issues
If you discover a security vulnerability, please:
1. Do not disclose publicly
2. Email security@yourdomain.com
3. Include detailed information
4. Allow reasonable time for response

## Updates

- [ ] CORS origins are properly configured

## âœ… Deployment Process

### Initial Setup
- [ ] Clone repository on EC2 instance
- [ ] Run `./setup-production.sh`

- [ ] Check SSL certificates are generated

### Application Deployment
- [ ] Run `./deploy-prod.sh`
- [ ] Monitor deployment logs
- [ ] Verify all containers are running
- [ ] Check container health status

## âœ… Post-Deployment Verification

### Service Health Checks
- [ ] Frontend loads at `https://54.159.160.253`
- [ ] Admin panel accessible at `https://54.159.160.253/admin/`
- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Database connections are working
- [ ] AWS S3 integration is working

### Functional Testing
- [ ] User registration works
- [ ] User login works
- [ ] Profile photos load correctly
- [ ] Verified cards display properly
- [ ] Admin login works
- [ ] All API endpoints respond correctly

### Performance & Security
- [ ] SSL certificates are valid (not self-signed warnings)
- [ ] Security headers are present
- [ ] Rate limiting is active
- [ ] Audit logging is working
- [ ] File upload security is enforced

## âœ… Monitoring Setup

### Log Monitoring
- [ ] Application logs are being written
- [ ] Error logs are accessible
- [ ] Audit logs are being generated
- [ ] Log rotation is configured

### Resource Monitoring
- [ ] CPU usage is acceptable
- [ ] Memory usage is within limits
- [ ] Disk space is sufficient
- [ ] Network traffic is normal

## âœ… Backup & Recovery

### Backup Configuration
- [ ] Database backup strategy is in place
- [ ] Application state backup is configured
- [ ] SSL certificate backup is available
- [ ] Environment configuration is backed up

### Recovery Testing
- [ ] Backup restoration process is tested
- [ ] Rollback procedure is documented
- [ ] Emergency contact information is available

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Common Commands
```bash
# Check container status
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps

# View logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f [service_name]

# Restart a service
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart [service_name]

# Health check
curl -f https://54.159.160.253/health
```

### Emergency Procedures
```bash
# Stop all services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml down

# Rollback to previous version
git checkout <previous-commit>
./deploy-prod.sh
```
